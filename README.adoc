== SuperHero application on KumuluzEE

This project is a https://ee.kumuluz.com[KumuluzEE] variation of the https://github.com/andymc12/SuperHeroDatabase[SuperHeroDatabase] project which serves as the basis for the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-graphql[MicroProfile GraphQL] project TCK.

KumuluzEE provides a convenient https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-graphql[GraphQL extension] based on https://github.com/leangen/graphql-spqr[spqr]. This is a good option until there are some MicroProfile GraphQL implementations around.

For the sake of simplicity, the project does not include any test.

This project has been developped to evaluate GraphQL Java clients such as Amex Nodes.

The build generates an executable jar file in the target directory.

Nothing easier to run it:
[source,shell]
----
java -jar target/KumHeroDatabase-1.0.jar
----

You can then connect to the GraphIQL interface with the following URL:
[source,http]
----

http://localhost:8080/graphiql
----

An run some GraphQL queries such as:
[source,json]
----
query allHeroes {
  allHeroes {
    name
    primaryLocation
    superPowers
    realName
  }
}
----

----
[source,json]
query allAvengers {
  allHeroesInTeam(team: "Avengers") {
    name
    primaryLocation
    superPowers
  }
}
----

----
[source,json]
mutation createNewHero {
  createNewHero(hero: {name: "Captain America", realName: "Steven Rogers", superPowers: ["Super strength", "Vibranium Shield"], primaryLocation: "New York, NY", teamAffiliations: [{name: "Avengers"}]}) {
    name
    primaryLocation
    superPowers
    realName
  }
}
----

Have fun!
